As part of the appeal, Bonnie and her mother are “encouraging people to host an event and raise money to help mothers worldwide lift themselves and their families out of poverty for good.” About her trip to Senegal in 2012, Bonnie said, “You know you’re making videos to share their stories but to feel they’re going to be helped long-term is difficult. The main hospital was oversubscribed, all these people needed help but it was too late. That was the hardest thing — you wanted to give them hope but at the same time their situation was so desperate. I met a woman called Dianasa and her husband, who come from generations of farmers. These floods meant her husband had to go to town and find other work. I saw how one person is forced into an unknown environment and their morale is completely pulled down. That stuck with me.” Bonnie also spoke about how she ended up getting role of Ginny Weasley, which started when her older brother “told me I remind him of Ginny. You believe everything your older brother says. We asked my mum and she didn’t know how to go about getting me an audition but being a driven mother she called up Bloomsbury, who gave her the number for the casting director.” Bonnie said that “Harry Potter is “10 years of good memories” and that she knows that “any step I go on to now is thanks to that and I’ll never forget it’s been part of my foundation.” On kissing Daniel in the films, she said, “It was unusual. We’d known each other eight years. I was 17 so it wasn’t my first kiss. It becomes mechanical in front of lots of people but it’s better than it being a stranger, someone you’ve never met.” Bonnie’s next project is a film called The Sea, which is out next month, while she is “also finishing two films she directed, and acting in another that must remain under wraps for now.“ Bonnie also discusses her love for London, the Burning Man Festival, and her boyfriend. To find out what else she had to say, check out the full interview here.

Studio Tour London - The Making of Harry Potter is due to take place from April 4-27 and to be ready for those exciting three weeks, Buckbeak has had a bit of a make-over. Everyone's favorite Hippogriff is now more than 12 years of age and because he hasn't been refreshed since he was first created for Prisoner of Azkaban, it's important that he looks his very best considering he'll be one of the main attractions during the event. ATV Today reported that Val Jones, who was a member of the creature effects team on the Potter films and one of those responsible for Buckbeak's creation, was "called in to re-feather and preen the delicate winged creature." Talking about working on said Hippogriff, Jones stated: "Buckbeak was one of the most challenging creatures I've ever worked on. It took almost a year and a team of 20 to build three versions of him. We worked closely with mechanical engineers to replicate the exact wing movement and skeleton of a real bird. Each version required thousands of feathers to be sorted, dyed and then individually glued in place by hand. As the Buckbeak ok show at the Studio Tour is more than 12 years old now, it's important to refresh and replenish his coat as the glue wears and feathers come loose when he bows." Jones started her career as a Textiles Designer before moving on to working with feathers, hair and animatronics. She will be appearing at "Feathers and Flight" to "lead an expert team to demonstrate the techniques that made winged wonders such as Buckbeak the Hippogriff and Fawkes the Phoenix a reality on screen." To find out more about the event and to book your tickets, visit the Studio Tour website now! Has anyone purchased their tickets ready? Are you excited for the event?

Posted by Toni on 03-21-2014 at 1:05 PM Share Tweet       Rowling releases PART 2 of the ALL-NEW Quidditch World Cup information on Pottermore Last week, author J.K. Rowling released Part 1 of her special Quidditch World Cup segment on Pottermore as part of a reward for her request of fans to to show support using the hashtag #wizards4scotlandrugby on Twitter. Today, she has released Part II. The first part of the new content provided historical background on the fictional Quidditch World Cup tournament with some memorable (and NOT so memorable) moments from the past championships. It also included Rowling's wry observations about the sport as it has caught the attention of worldwide media from New Zealand to Alaska. This second part relays the Quidditch World Cup's more recent history with witty recaps of each tournament (held every four years) from 1990 to 2010, and includes a look forward to this year's Quidditch World Cup 2014, which will be held in April. In 'History of the Quidditch World Cup' Part II, 'Quidditch World Cup 1990-2014)', we can learn: Which small country managed to beat China in a furiously contested match lasting 3 days Which country's team almost refused to play when their team mascots - a kind of African house-elf called a Yumboe - were all arrested outside the stadium Which 'Seeker' had a short-lived stint as Burkina Faso's Minister for Magic following his team's win Which Scottish player famously lambasted his hereditary short fingers for missing the Snitch in the 1990 Canada - Scotland final And we find out key information about the Quidditch World Cup 2014: Where this year's Quidditch World Cup will be held (because of the International Statute of Secrecy, venues are usually remote moors, deserts or deserted islands) The full line-up of the sixteen countries competing, with J.K. Rowling's pre-tournament predictions and insider tips Which infamous player has come out of retirement to play in the Quidditch World Cup 2014 (he plays a big part in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) Pottermore is the only place to find original new writing by J.K. Rowling about the world of Harry Potter. Her 'History of the Quidditch World Cup' is one of the longest pieces she has written for Pottermore, and was written within the last month. You can find the second part of the content by logging in to Pottermore.com and going to 'The Golden Stadium' moment in Chapter 8 of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire from today. You wonderful people retweeted #wizards4scotlandrugbyteam, so go to #pottermore for a load of new information on the Quidditch World Cup! — J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) March 14, 2014 Leave a comment.

Posted by Keith on 03-21-2014 at 09:00 AM Share Tweet   Rumor Control: The live-action adaptation of 'The Little Mermaid' As part of MuggleNet's 2013 April Fool's day festivities, we created a fictional news story announcing that Emma Watson would be starring in a live-action version of The Little Mermaid. Along with some help from Photoshop, we fooled a few readers and had fun imagining what a live action version of this classic story starring Emma Watson might look like. We were amused this February when our fake story popped up as a rumor around the internet, although some attentive news outlets traced the rumor back to us, debunking the rumor once and for all - or so we thought! In the past couple of days, reputable outlets such as Deadline and the Los Angeles Times are reporting that director Sofia Coppola (who helmed The Bling Ring starring Emma Watson) is in talks to direct a live action version of - you guessed it - The Little Mermaid. From Deadline: "Sofia Coppola is negotiating to direct The Little Mermaid, a live-action version of the classic Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale for Universal Pictures and Working Title partners Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner. Caroline Thompson of Edward Scissorhands fame is rewriting the script, about the mermaid willing to make a Faustian bargain to live on land after she falls in love. Previous drafts were done by Fifty Shades Of Grey scribe Kelly Marcel and Shame scribe Abi Morgan, and Joe Wright was at one time eyeing this to direct." At first we were worried that this was just another rumor popping up, but the fact that the story's been out there a couple of days without being officially debunked plus the fact that it's being reported by credible sources is starting to make it look like it's true. However, some of these reports are starting to include a familiar sounding detail - that Emma Watson will star in Sofia Coppola's adaptation. As of yet, there is no credible source linking Emma to this new live action version, so beware of any post claiming this is true. We'll let you know if there are any further developments on Coppola's adaptation - or Emma's involvement. In the mean time, we'll just bask in the fact that we probably gave Universal Pictures the idea! Leave a comment. Discuss this in the MuggleNet Chat. Posted by Jessica on 03-21-2014 at 08:55 AM Share Tweet   Number 4 Privet Drive for sale near Leavesden Studios When the Hussain family bought number 4 Privet Drive, they didn’t realize the significance of the address. It was their son Zaine, who was reading the books at the time, who excitedly informed them that it was Harry Potter’s house! Now the house is back up for sale, available to anyone who wishes to live at this special location. The house was built on a private road in Leavesden in 2012, near the Warner Bros. Studio Tour London – The Making of Harry Potter. Note that no filming was done at this house. The Dursley house used in Philosopher’s Stone was actually a house in Bracknell on Picket Post Close, and for the remaining movies, a set was built at Leavesden Studios. Both the Hussain children, Zaine, 15, and Mariyah, 10, are huge fans of Harry Potter, and often invite their friends to take pictures and visit the Studio Tour. However, the private road does not appear on any maps, and not many people know that it’s there. Sounds like some other magical buildings we could name! Of selling the house, Mrs Hussain said, "My kids are so sad to be leaving but it’s really nice to be able to say that we once lived here. It’s been a very special time." What would you do if you lived at number 4 Privet Drive? Let us know in the comments below! Leave a comment. Discuss this in the MuggleNet Chat.

Bill Nighy, Ralph Fiennes, and Helena Bonham Carter’s Turks and Caicos premieres tonight on BBC Two. The television movie is the second in The Worricker Trilogy centering around MI5 agent Johnny Worricker. Also just announced yesterday, the final installment to the trilogy, Salting the Battlefield, will air March 27 on the same network. Speaking of Helena, her return to Wonderland as the Red Queen in the sequel Through the Looking Glass has nearly been confirmed. According to Variety, the actress is in final negotiations to reprise the role, although Alan Rickman’s involvement in the sequel is still unknown. Shortly after the Variety report, Helena was also seen at Save The Children’s reggae night, where she supported the charity fundraiser with her Harry Potter co-star Helen McCrory, who will next be seen on stage in the tragedy Medea. Helena hosted the charity event and spoke with the press about making a difference: “Children are vulnerable throughout the world... For me, it's a privilege to be able to try to do something to make a difference.” Whatever happened to Reg Cattermole? When we last saw Steffan Rhodri, his character Reg was at the Ministry standing in not much more than his underclothes and looking very confused. You’ll be happy to know that Steffan is doing well and starring in a one-man (and two pigs!) show at the Gate Theatre, with its run ending March 29. To learn more about his show or buy tickets, visit the website. Domhnall Gleeson, Jim Broadbent, and Julie Walters have been cast in Brooklyn, which begins filming soon in Ireland. The film is based on a novel of the same name by author Colm Toibin about a young Irish immigrant making her way in New York. Domhnall has been cast as Jim Farrell, while Jim and Julie’s parts have not yet been revealed. In addition to this role, it has been rumored that Domhnall is being considered for another, more villainous part in the reboot of the Fantastic Four film. According to The Wrap, Domhnall is being considered for Dr. Doom and the film is due for release in 2015. Finally, Gleeson’s co-star, Clemence Poesy is also rumored to be in consideration for another role. According to a Sky spokeswoman, discussion is currently taking place regarding a sequel to Poesy’s previous drama series, The Tunnel, which was immensely successful and aired last year on Sky Atlantic. If the second series does come to fruition, we could see Poesy reunited with Stephen Dillane, father of HP alum Frank Dillane. That’s all for this edition of Role Call.
